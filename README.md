# This project is a single-page app called Mail, which showcases my JavaScript skills. The app uses JavaScript's fetching capabilities to load every inbox. Database interactions are handled through GET, POST, and PUT methods.

# [Visit Live App](https://mail-app.herokuapp.com/)

## The app has the following key features:

1. Register and login functionality
2. Inbox, sent, and archived mailboxes
3. Ability to compose and send emails
4. Archive and unarchive emails in the inbox
5. View emails and reply to the sender
6. Read emails are displayed in gray, while unread emails are in yellow.

## To test the application, you need to register two emails. This will allow you to send messages to an existing email without encountering any errors.

## Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
